# IFY

A simple URL shortener built for personal needs.
Feed it with a URL that will respond with a slug that you can use instead.

| Input          | Output              |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| https://dvl.sh | https://ify.lol/0KY |

> Not a factual representation of the output, but simplified for clarity.

I have a CNAME of https://r.dvl.sh, which maps to https://ify.lol for convenience, as I'm using this shortener internally within my website: https://dvl.sh.

If you want to use this URL shortener for your personal needs, you won't be able to use it through https://ify.lol as it will require an `Access-Token`. It is a security precaution, as I want the database to contain only the links I use in my blog posts.
Besides, whenever I make a breaking change, I do not want your links to disappear from the database.

Feel free to clone or fork this repo, make desired changes _(if any)_ and deploy it yourself wherever you want.

## Usage

### Api

With just two endpoints, you can do the necessary task.

1. **GET** `/api/[slug]` - to retrieve `JSON` data of a record by the identifier _(slug)_
2. **POST** `/api` - to store an URL and retrieve `JSON` for that record

**POST** request will expect you to pass a `link` as data and an `Access-Token` header that will match the `ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.

### Redirect

The middleware handles the redirect if the database finds the given slug; otherwise, it will remain with `404` status.

1. `/[slug]`

## Deployment

Personally deployed on [â–² Vercel](https://vercel.com) and database on [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/).
There are a few environment variables that you need to fill in, and everything will work as expected. Refer to `.env.example`.
